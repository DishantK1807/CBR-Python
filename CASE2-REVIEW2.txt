"Great TV - seamlessly connects to the wifi so I can access Netflix, iplayer and the various other apps that you can save to your app screen. Great visual quality. Split screen capabilities. Very lightweight, slim. I bought the connecting sound base with mine so I've not actually used the volume on the TV at all but they go together peaches and cream."
